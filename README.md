Hypertension Prediction is an advanced machine learning project designed to predict and classify various hypertension stages in patients based on clinical parameters and lifestyle factors. The system utilizes supervised learning algorithms to analyze health data and provide accurate predictions along with personalized medical recommendations.

Description:-
Scenario 1: Hypertensive Patient Monitoring

A patient with diagnosed hypertension visits a healthcare facility where the Hypertension Prediction system is deployed. By entering their clinical parameters including blood pressure readings, symptoms, medication status, and lifestyle factors, the system provides an immediate risk assessment and classification. Healthcare providers can use this prediction to make informed decisions about treatment adjustments and patient monitoring frequency.

Scenario 2: Preventive Health Screening

A healthcare facility conducts routine health screenings for at-risk populations. Using the Hypertension Prediction system, medical staff can quickly assess individuals who may be developing hypertension before it becomes critical. The system identifies patients in early stages (Stage-1) who could benefit from lifestyle interventions and preventive measures.

Scenario 3: Emergency Department Triage

In emergency department settings, the Hypertension Prediction system assists medical staff in rapidly triaging patients with cardiovascular complaints. By analyzing vital signs and patient history, the system can identify hypertensive crises that require immediate intervention, helping prioritize critical cases.
